## My process

I usually develop the design part with a design created in Figma, often using a grid. When developing in React, I frequently use Emotion or Styled Components. This kind of challenge is interesting as it brings me back to the basics plus without Figma, but with a little extra touch â€“ SCSS. I feel more organized and scalable with SCSS, even though this component may not be scalable (but it's still good practice, isn't it?).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS preprocessor
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

I love sharing my work with other people and contributing to what I already find interesting to comment on, so I will continue interacting with people in the frontendmentor community.

### Useful resources

- [SASS Docs](https://sass-lang.com/) - This is the official documentations of sass. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward on very simple projects to pratice the basics.

## Acknowledgments

It's not easy to make a perfect design without figma, with figma it's a little more difficult, but the more our frontend eyes are trained to see details, the more we will be successful when development is easier, in this case, when you have a team, or the design in hand, so congratulations to everyone who had the courage to face this challenge of responsiveness and handling images.
